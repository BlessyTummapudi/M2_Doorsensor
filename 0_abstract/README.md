 ## About the Project
 
 * Project's name is Door Sensor.This project is a simple monitoring of door sensor ,when it opens the LED is turned ON when the door is closed LED is OFF without changing the state of other pins.
*  Door sensor senses the opening and closing of the door,the device comes with two pieces reed switch and magnet.The switch is closed when the two parts are sitting close to one another, and an electric current can flow. When the switch opens, the two parts separate, causing the electrical current to stop and the circuit to deactivate.
*  Wherein One piece attaches on the door frame, and the other attaches parallel to the first piece on the door itself. The two parts create a closed circuit when the door is shut. As the door opens, the magnet and switch separate, breaking the circuit. When the circuit breaks, the sensor signals the central control panel.
* The two pieces must sit directly next to each other with only a small amount of space between them. If they’re too far away or aren’t parallel to one another, the pieces can’t interact and the reed switch and magnet won’t create a circuit.
